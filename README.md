# AndroidBlanky
Creating a new blank Android app is a pain and takes time. Creating this blank Android project should be the last time I have to do it. 

*NOTE: The manifest file is using the Internet permission by default as lots of apps do and this project as RetroFit installed. Remove if not going to need it.*
